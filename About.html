            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>The special thing about this show is the life lessons it teaches us. It shows us that taking responsibility is an important thing in man's life and it is the thing that develops a person. It also clearly shows us how keeping secrets influences relationships in a bad way. It shows us the value of friendships and that we should appreciate our family.</p>
